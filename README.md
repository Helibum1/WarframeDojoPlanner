# WarframeDojoPlanner

The goal of this project is to create a tool to plan how you want to build your Dojo in Warframe.

The images of the dojos rooms weren't created by us. They were posted by the user Hunter on the Warframe-forum.

TODO:

    -Correct the forma cost for the higher tier clans for the small and large garden and 
     for the observatory and the Temple of Honor(aka UtilityRoomTrophy.rdef)
    
    -Handle the image of the elevator
